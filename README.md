# RCNL website

## Getting Started

### Local Development

If it is the first time running this project locally then please install all necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Once installed, run the following command to kick off a local version of the website:

```bash
vite dev
```

Any changes made to the code on your local machine will automatically update the local version of the website.

### Remote Deployment

Once you have tested your changes, git commit and push them to the `main` branch. Then from your local machine run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy your changes live to the [rcnl.rice.edu](rcnl.rice.edu) domain.

## Tooling

This project was created using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) build tooling, the [React](https://react.dev/) web library, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework.
